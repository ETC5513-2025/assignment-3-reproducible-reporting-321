## Problem Introduction

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 60%;"}
- COVID-19 began spreading worldwide in early 2020, affecting countries in different ways.
- Governments responded with testing, lockdowns, and vaccines, but results varied.
- This project focuses on:
    - **Canada**
    - **France**
    - **Germany**
    - **India**
    - **United Kingdom**
    - **United States**
:::

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 60%;"}
**Goal:**  
Comparing how COVID-19 changed over time in each country, and whether vaccines helped reduce cases and deaths.

## Results Summary (will add the plots)

-   **Vaccination Rolled Out After Cases Rose**

-   **Vaccines Helped Reduce Deaths Over Time**

-   **Vaccines Slowed the Spread After Rollout**

## Conclusion

::: {.fragment}
After analyzing the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data from six different countries.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Key Findings:**
:::

::: {.fragment}
1. Case numbers often rose before widespread vaccination began.
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. Major outbreaks led to sharp daily changes in both cases and vaccine doses.
:::

3. A 7-day lag analysis showed that higher vaccination rates were followed by fewer new cases, especially where rollout was early and sustained.
