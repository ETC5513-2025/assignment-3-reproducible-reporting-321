## Problem Introduction

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
-   COVID-19 began spreading worldwide in early 2020, affecting countries in different ways.
-   Governments responded with testing, lockdowns, and vaccines, but results varied.
-   This project focuses on:
    -   **Canada**
    -   **France**
    -   **Germany**
    -   **India**
    -   **United Kingdom**
    -   **United States**

**Goal:**\
Comparing how COVID-19 changed over time in each country, and whether vaccines helped reduce cases and deaths.

## Dataset Description

-   **Data Includes:**
    -   Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases
    -   COVID-19 deaths
    -   Vaccination rates
-   **Source:** [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
-   **Time Period:** 
 - February 2020 – February 2023
 - January 16, 2021 – September 4, 2022 (Vaccination Rates)

## Methods

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
1. **Data Source**: 
COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates data from Our World in Data.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing:** 
filtering and cleaning data using R, removing missing values.

3. **Selected Countries for Comparison:** 
Canada, France, Germany, India, the UK, and the US.

4. **Time periods:**

## Results Summary (will add the plots)

-   **Vaccination Rolled Out After Cases Rose**

-   **Vaccines Helped Reduce Deaths Over Time**

-   **Vaccines Slowed the Spread After Rollout**

## Conclusion

After analyzing the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data from six different countries

**Key Findings:**

1.  Case numbers often rose before widespread vaccination began.
2.  Major outbreaks led to sharp daily changes in both cases and vaccine doses.
3.  A 7-day lag analysis showed that higher vaccination rates were followed by fewer new cases, especially where rollout was early and sustained.
